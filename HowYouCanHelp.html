<h3>What can be done?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provide more training, better training, and stricter training</li>
<li>Diversify the workforce so that there are different views on crimes, etc.</li>
<li>Join scholars to advocate for documenting police related deaths as notifiable conditions so that public health departments can monitor these deaths.</li> 
<li>Learn about how structural racism and white supremacy operate within institutions, policies and laws.</li>
<li>Support movements like Black Lives Matter that raise awareness of police brutality, and help expose and dismantle structural racism.</li>
<li>Regardless of your field of work, evaluate whether policies, laws, requirements, guidelines, etc., have unintentional negative consequences for people of color. Similarly, evaluate whether they disproportionately benefit white people and think of ways to level the playing field.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Know Your Rights</h3>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>U.S. law enforcement officers and other officials like judges, prosecutors, and security guards have been given tremendous power by local, state, and federal government agenciesâ€”authority they must have to enforce the law and ensure justice in our country. These powers include the authority to detain and arrest suspects, to search and seize property, to bring criminal charges, to make rulings in court, and to use deadly force in certain situations. However, this power can easily be abuse by police officers.
 <li>Support calls for more collaboration and partnerships among communities, researchers, policymakers and law enforcement systems.</li>
 <li>Learn about how structural racism and white supremacy operate within institutions, policies and laws.
