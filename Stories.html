<h3>Jacqueline Craig</h3>
<p> A woman named Jacqueline Craig called the police saying a full grown white male choked her 7 year old son just for littering. In an article published by The Sun called "Nobody Deserves That," it says that the officer talked to both the victim and the accused but then questions the mother's parenting skills and says "why don't you just teach your son not to litter?" Then Craig responds saying it doesn't matter how her child is raised, he still has no right to put his hands on him, then the officer responds with "why not?" It is at this point that the mother starts to get mad and begins to yell. In the article, it states "The officer, now aggravated himself says: 'If you keep yelling at me, you're going to piss me off and I'm going take you to jail' It is around this point her daughter, Brea Hymond, 19, tries to intervene. But the cop then pushes Hymond out of the way and grabs Craig and pushes her to the ground, pressing a Taser gun into her back".</p>

<h3>John Geer</h3>
<p>The shooting of John Geer occurred on August 29, 2013, in the Pohick Hills neighborhood of Springfield, Virginia.

Torres was charged with second degree murder on August 27, 2015, and on June 25, 2016, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment, including time served.
